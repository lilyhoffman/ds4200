    <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Student academic success and dropout rates are critical topics in education research, reflecting the overall effectiveness of educational systems and the well-being of students. Academic success, often measured by grades, graduation rates, or skill acquisition, has a profound impact on a student's future opportunities, career prospects, and socioeconomic mobility. On the other hand, dropout rates serve as an indicator of systemic issues, such as access to resources, student engagement, or the quality of support services. Understanding the factors influencing both academic success and dropout rates is essential not only for improving educational practices but also for shaping policies that foster equitable learning environments. Investigating these topics can offer insights into how schools, teachers, and policymakers can reduce dropout rates, thereby ensuring that more students achieve their full academic potential and contribute meaningfully to society.

        Learn more about academic success and dropout rates through these resources:
        <a href="https://educationaltechnologyjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41239-020-0177-7">Research on predicting academic success</a> or a
        <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340406248_STUDENTS'_ACADEMIC_PERFORMANCE_AND_DROPOUT_PREDICTION">paper on dropout prediction</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both of these studies systematically explore the factors influencing student success rates and propose methodologies to address this multifaceted issue. A key feature of their approach is the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques, which offer a more nuanced perspective on the analysis and interpretation of the data, ultimately enhancing the robustness of their conclusions. These papers provide valuable insights for a more in-depth examination of underlying trends in the data and serve as a foundation for comparing results derived from our visualizations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data pre-processing is a crucial step to ensure the dataset is clean and well-structured for analysis. This includes handling missing data by removing or imputing values to improve accuracy, normalizing numerical features for consistent scaling, and selecting relevant features by analyzing correlations to enhance data quality. These steps lay a solid foundation for meaningful and accurate insights.    </p>
    <p>
        The analysis involves descriptive statistics to summarize key metrics and explore correlations between student success factors and dropout rates. Predictive modeling using techniques like Logistic Regression will identify dropout risks and evaluate model performance. Additionally, cluster analysis will uncover patterns by grouping students based on similar academic behaviors, helping to pinpoint factors associated with success or risk.

    <p>
        The visualization highlights the relationship between age at enrollment and unemployment rate, 
        with marital status represented through distinct line colors. By focusing on the full age range 
        and grouping data by marital status, we observe that single individuals and married individuals
        exhibit different trends. Single individuals tend to have slightly higher variability in unemployment
        rates across the age spectrum, while married individuals show steadier trends. The data points and
        gridlines improve the graph's readability, and the tooltip provides interactive insights for
        specific data points. This visualization underscores how age, unemployment, and marital 
        status interplay, offering a clearer understanding of how these factors relate.

                The interactive scatter plot provides insights into the relationships between age at enrollment, outcomes, and scholarship status, while also allowing for dynamic exploration by marital status. The user may use the slider to manipulate the relationship status of the student to aid in identifying patterns, similarities, or discrepancies in the age at enrollment based on their relationship status. Key takeaways include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Age and Outcomes:</strong> Patterns or clusters in the distribution of outcomes (e.g., dropout, enrolled, graduate) across different age groups can reveal how age at enrollment influences success rates. For instance, younger or older students might be more likely to drop out or graduate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Scholarship Impact:</strong> The color distinction for scholarship holders helps identify whether financial support correlates with better outcomes. For example, clusters of scholarship holders near "graduate" outcomes may suggest a positive influence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Marital Status as a Contextual Factor:</strong> The animation frame adds marital status as a dimension, allowing you to assess how marital status interacts with age, scholarships, and outcomes. Differences across frames may highlight unique trends, such as married students being more likely to graduate or drop out depending on age.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Some of the interesting takeaways include a slightly higher dropout rate than graduation rate for single students with scholarships. However, when analyzing the data for divorced students we noticed most graduating students received scholarhsips, with a spike in scholarship holding students between the ages of 30 and 40. There also tends to be a similar range of ages for students who graduate and dropout contrary to our hypothesis of older students having a higher graduation rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                The range of enrollment age is also much greater for students who are single or married than for any other relationship status.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, the graph enables a nuanced understanding of how demographic and financial variables intersect with educational outcomes.

    <h4>Model Insights</h4>
    <p>The plots provide meaningful insights into the underlying data based on the model's behavior and feature importance. The feature importance plot reveals which variables in the dataset are most strongly associated with the target outcome, indicating which factors are likely driving the observed patterns in the data. The importance rankings can also expose relationships within the data, such as which attributes contribute more to the variability in the target, helping to identify key predictors. Additionally, the distribution of feature importance, whether it's concentrated on a few features or spread out, tells us whether the data relies heavily on certain predictors or is more evenly distributed.</p>
    <p>In this case, the most influential features are <strong>"age at enrollment"</strong> and <strong>"course"</strong> due to the strong connection they have to predicting the participation in school, and therefore are the highest importance in predicting the students' status of graduated, enrolled, or dropout. Besides showing which features are the most influential in the random feature model, the feature importance also shows us that there tends to be a shallow decrease in prediction effect on the rest of the statistical data with "age at enrollment" and "course" at 11% and 10% with the other features averaging at ~7% significance.</p>
    <p>From the confusion matrix, the accuracy across different classes can reflect whether the data has imbalanced classes or overlapping features that make some categories harder to distinguish. If certain classes consistently show high misclassification rates, it might suggest noisy or insufficient data in those areas, indicating a need for further data collection or refinement.</p>
    <p>As we analyze the confusion matrix and the results of the XGBoost model, our focus isn't on improving accuracy; it is learning as much as possible about the data. From the confusion matrix and results, we can see that the prediction results of graduate and dropout individuals are much easier to predict, allowing us to assume more consistent features.

    <h3>Sankey Diagram representing Pathways to Graduation</h3>
    <p>
        The provided Sankey diagram visualizes the pathways students take from their mode of application (left) through their 
        chosen courses (middle) to their final outcomes (right). Each flow represents a group of students, with the thickness 
        of the lines proportional to the number of students transitioning along that path. The diagram categorizes the entry 
        modes into options like "general contingent," "special contingent," and "international student," linking them to various
        academic programs, such as "Nursing," "Management," or "Veterinary Nursing." These courses are further connected to 
        outcomes, including "Graduate," "Dropout," or "Enrolled." This visualization is highly effective for understanding 
        the diversity of student trajectories, identifying key entry points and popular courses, and analyzing trends in completion 
        or dropout rates. By enabling easy identification of bottlenecks or success patterns, it can aid in policy-making, resource 
        allocation, and improving institutional practices to support student success.

    <!-- Summary Section -->
    <h3>Overview and Next Steps</h3>
    <p>
        The analysis reveals significant patterns in student academic success and dropout rates, with key insights derived from data visualizations and predictive models. Visualizations highlight the influence of factors like age at enrollment, marital status, and scholarship status on academic outcomes, showing that younger and older students tend to exhibit distinct trends in dropout or graduation rates. Predictive modeling emphasizes the importance of features such as "age at enrollment" and "course" in determining outcomes, while the confusion matrix suggests that predicting dropout and graduation statuses is more reliable than other outcomes.
        Future work can address imbalances in class distribution and refine feature selection to improve model performance and provide deeper insights. Additionally, expanding the dataset or integrating external factors, such as institutional policies or regional economic conditions, could enhance understanding and inform strategies to promote equitable and effective education systems.    </p>
