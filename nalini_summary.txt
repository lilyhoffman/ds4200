The visualization highlights the relationship between age at enrollment and unemployment rate, 
with marital status represented through distinct line colors. By focusing on the full age range 
and grouping data by marital status, we observe that single individuals and married individuals
exhibit different trends. Single individuals tend to have slightly higher variability in unemployment
rates across the age spectrum, while married individuals show steadier trends. The data points and
gridlines improve the graph's readability, and the tooltip provides interactive insights for
specific data points. This visualization underscores how age, unemployment, and marital 
status interplay, offering a clearer understanding of how these factors relate.
