The interactive visualizations provide a comprehensive understanding of how demographic, economic, and educational factors interact to influence outcomes.

The first visualization, a line and scatter plot, explores the relationship between unemployment rate and age at enrollment among students aged 23 and older. The data is segmented by marital status (single vs. married), revealing intriguing patterns. Single students exhibit a broader range of both ages and unemployment rates, suggesting greater diversity in their enrollment circumstances. Conversely, married students tend to cluster within a narrower range, possibly reflecting different economic or personal factors that influence their decisions. The trajectories of the plotted lines provide additional insights into the correlation between these variables, offering opportunities to identify critical thresholds or trends.

The second visualization, a bar chart, highlights the distribution of student outcomes (e.g., enrolled, graduated, dropped out) across marital statuses. This chart shows significant differences in outcomes, with divorced students experiencing a disproportionately high dropout rate compared to their peers. Single and married students display more balanced distributions, indicating varied experiences within these groups. The interactive legend allows users to focus on specific outcomes, such as graduation rates, enabling detailed comparisons and a deeper understanding of these trends.

Together, these visualizations create a nuanced picture of how age, unemployment, and marital status influence educational outcomes. They suggest potential areas for intervention, such as providing targeted support for divorced or single students who may face unique challenges. By leveraging these insights, institutions can better tailor their strategies to support student success.
