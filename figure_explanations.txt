Graph: Confusion Matrix

    Marks: Area

    Channels: Position, Color

    Why we chose this type of visualization: We chose a confusion matrix because it’s the best way to 
                                         evaluate a classification model’s performance across multiple categories. It lets
                                          us easily compare actual vs. predicted outcomes and pinpoint where the model struggles. 
                                          By normalizing the values, we can better interpret relative performance without being 
                                          affected by class size differences.

    Why did we include the specific color and interactions in the figure: The color gradient ranges from light to dark blue to represent 
                                                                    prediction accuracy. Darker shades show better predictions, making it 
                                                                    easy to focus on areas with strong performance (like Graduates). The 
                                                                    colors are also intuitive and visually distinct, ensuring clarity.
                                                                    This is a static image, so there are no interactive elements present.

    Other information about the graph, we want the graders to know: This confusion matrix is based on a Random Forest model, which explains 
                                                                why the performance varies by class. The model does better at predicting 
                                                                Graduates compared to Enrolled students, likely due to clearer patterns in 
                                                                the data for Graduates.


Graph: Feature Importance

    Marks: Height of the bars (Areas)

    Channels: Position, size (height), color

    Why we chose this type of visualization: A bar chart is ideal for showcasing feature importance because it allows for a clear comparison
                                             of how much each feature contributes to the model’s decision-making. The sorted order 
                                             from highest to lowest importance helps focus attention on the most impactful features first.

    Why did we include the specific color and interactions in the figure: The consistent use of blue keeps the graph simple and easy 
                                                                        to interpret, avoiding any distractions from color variations. 
                                                                        The choice of dark blue provides good contrast against the background.

    Other information about the graph, we want the graders to know: The top two features, age at enrollment and course, stand out with 
                                                                    the highest importance scores (0.11 and 0.10), suggesting that these are the 
                                                                    strongest predictors of student outcomes.
