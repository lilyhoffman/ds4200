Graph: Student Age at Enrollment Vs. Outcome
    
    Marks: Points

    Channels: Horizontal position for Age, Verticle position for Outcome

    Why we chose this type of visualization: We chose this interactive scatter plot in order to evaluate the relationship between age at enrollment and the outcomes of students. We originally hypothesized that students that enrolled at a later age would be more inclinded to graduated than dropout. However, when analyzing the data throught his visualization we realized that there wasnt a correlation between an increased age at enrollment and graduation rate. We also chose this scatter plot due to the categorical nature of the outcomes (graduate, dropout, enrolled) making age discpreancies easier to read, along with options to add additional interactions such as marital status.

    Why did we include the specific color and interactions in the figure: We decided to use marital status as an interaction to the scatter plot to attempt to identify any trends related to relationship status. Seperating students based on their relationship status of single, married, divorced, etc. could provide us with useful information such as age range, and graduation rates that looks beyond just age at enrollment. Thorugh this we noticed trends and patterns that we explained in our presentation that would have otherwise gone unnoticed without this interaction feature.

    Other information about the graph, we want the graders to know: We also added one other interaction to this graph allowing us to view the students scholarship status to help in identifying more trends, however adding 4 variables became too busy and made the graph harder to read so we removed it from the final presentation. The patterns easiest to see were the range of ages and the desity of outcomes associated with the ages, however we must seperate the data by marital status to analyze more in depth and be able to draw sound conclusions.


Graph: Confusion Matrix

    Marks: Area

    Channels: Position, Color

    Why we chose this type of visualization: We chose a confusion matrix because it’s the best way to 
                                         evaluate a classification model’s performance across multiple categories. It lets
                                          us easily compare actual vs. predicted outcomes and pinpoint where the model struggles. 
                                          By normalizing the values, we can better interpret relative performance without being 
                                          affected by class size differences.

    Why did we include the specific color and interactions in the figure: The color gradient ranges from light to dark blue to represent 
                                                                    prediction accuracy. Darker shades show better predictions, making it 
                                                                    easy to focus on areas with strong performance (like Graduates). The 
                                                                    colors are also intuitive and visually distinct, ensuring clarity.
                                                                    This is a static image, so there are no interactive elements present.

    Other information about the graph, we want the graders to know: This confusion matrix is based on a Random Forest model, which explains 
                                                                why the performance varies by class. The model does better at predicting 
                                                                Graduates compared to Enrolled students, likely due to clearer patterns in 
                                                                the data for Graduates.


Graph: Feature Importance

    Marks: Height of the bars (Areas)

    Channels: Position, size (height), color

    Why we chose this type of visualization: A bar chart is ideal for showcasing feature importance because it allows for a clear comparison
                                             of how much each feature contributes to the model’s decision-making. The sorted order 
                                             from highest to lowest importance helps focus attention on the most impactful features first.

    Why did we include the specific color and interactions in the figure: The consistent use of blue keeps the graph simple and easy 
                                                                        to interpret, avoiding any distractions from color variations. 
                                                                        The choice of dark blue provides good contrast against the background.

    Other information about the graph, we want the graders to know: The top two features, age at enrollment and course, stand out with 
                                                                    the highest importance scores (0.11 and 0.10), suggesting that these are the 
                                                                    strongest predictors of student outcomes.
