Unemployment Rate vs. Age at Enrollment (Line and Scatter Plot)
    
Marks:
- Line marks representing trends by marital status.
- Circle marks representing individual data points (scatter plot).

Channels:
- X-axis: Unemployment rate (%) to represent economic conditions.
- Y-axis: Age at enrollment to capture timing of educational decisions.
- Color: Distinction between marital statuses (magenta for single, green for married).

Why we chose this type of visualization:
This combination of a line and scatter plot allows us to visualize both overall trends and individual data points. It effectively shows the relationship between age, unemployment, and marital status, highlighting patterns and clusters that might otherwise be hidden.

Why did we include the specific color and interactions in the figure:
The color choices provide clear, easily distinguishable categories for marital status. The inclusion of magenta and green ensures contrast and visibility, even for those with color blindness. By segmenting the data into marital statuses, the graph emphasizes differences in unemployment-age relationships.

Other information about the graph, we want the graders to know:
We filtered the data to include only students aged 23 and above to focus on non-traditional enrollment ages. The gridlines and labels enhance interpretability, while the interaction enables a closer examination of specific trends.

Number of Students by Marital Status and Outcome (Bar Chart)
    
Marks:
- Bar marks representing counts of students by marital status and outcome.

Channels:
- X-axis: Marital status as categorical data.
- Y-axis: Count of students for quantitative comparison.
- Color: Outcome categories (e.g., enrolled, graduated, dropped out).
- Opacity: Dynamic highlighting of selected outcomes via legend interaction.

Why we chose this type of visualization:
The bar chart format is ideal for comparing distributions across discrete categories like marital status. It highlights disparities in outcomes, such as the high dropout rate among divorced students, while allowing for easy interpretation of proportional differences.

Why did we include the specific color and interactions in the figure:
Distinct colors for each outcome make comparisons straightforward. The interactive legend allows users to filter and focus on specific outcomes, improving usability and engagement with the data.

Other information about the graph, we want the graders to know:
This chart provides a snapshot of the relationship between marital status and educational outcomes, highlighting key trends such as the higher dropout rates for divorced students. It complements the scatter plot by contextualizing demographic data with educational results.


Graph: Student Age at Enrollment Vs. Outcome
    
    Marks: Points

    Channels: Horizontal position for Age, Verticle position for Outcome

    Why we chose this type of visualization: We chose this interactive scatter plot in order to evaluate the relationship 
                                            between age at enrollment and the outcomes of students. We originally hypothesized that
                                             students that enrolled at a later age would be more inclinded to graduated than dropout.
                                              However, when analyzing the data throught his visualization we realized that there wasnt 
                                              a correlation between an increased age at enrollment and graduation rate. We also chose 
                                              this scatter plot due to the categorical nature of the outcomes (graduate, dropout, enrolled) 
                                              making age discpreancies easier to read, along with options to add additional interactions 
                                              such as marital status.

    Why did we include the specific color and interactions in the figure: We decided to use marital status as an interaction to the scatter
                                                                         plot to attempt to identify any trends related to relationship status. 
                                                                         Seperating students based on their relationship status of single, married, 
                                                                         divorced, etc. could provide us with useful information such as age range, 
                                                                         and graduation rates that looks beyond just age at enrollment. Thorugh this 
                                                                         we noticed trends and patterns that we explained in our presentation that 
                                                                         would have otherwise gone unnoticed without this interaction feature.

    Other information about the graph, we want the graders to know: We also added one other interaction to this graph allowing us to view the students
                                                                     scholarship status to help in identifying more trends, however adding 4 variables became
                                                                      too busy and made the graph harder to read so we removed it from the final presentation. 
                                                                      The patterns easiest to see were the range of ages and the desity of outcomes associated 
                                                                      with the ages, however we must seperate the data by marital status to analyze more in depth 
                                                                      and be able to draw sound conclusions.


Graph: Confusion Matrix

    Marks: Area

    Channels: Position, Color

    Why we chose this type of visualization: We chose a confusion matrix because it’s the best way to 
                                         evaluate a classification model’s performance across multiple categories. It lets
                                          us easily compare actual vs. predicted outcomes and pinpoint where the model struggles. 
                                          By normalizing the values, we can better interpret relative performance without being 
                                          affected by class size differences.

    Why did we include the specific color and interactions in the figure: The color gradient ranges from light to dark blue to represent 
                                                                    prediction accuracy. Darker shades show better predictions, making it 
                                                                    easy to focus on areas with strong performance (like Graduates). The 
                                                                    colors are also intuitive and visually distinct, ensuring clarity.
                                                                    This is a static image, so there are no interactive elements present.

    Other information about the graph, we want the graders to know: This confusion matrix is based on a Random Forest model, which explains 
                                                                why the performance varies by class. The model does better at predicting 
                                                                Graduates compared to Enrolled students, likely due to clearer patterns in 
                                                                the data for Graduates.


Graph: Feature Importance

    Marks: Height of the bars (Areas)

    Channels: Position, size (height), color

    Why we chose this type of visualization: A bar chart is ideal for showcasing feature importance because it allows for a clear comparison
                                             of how much each feature contributes to the model’s decision-making. The sorted order 
                                             from highest to lowest importance helps focus attention on the most impactful features first.

    Why did we include the specific color and interactions in the figure: The consistent use of blue keeps the graph simple and easy 
                                                                        to interpret, avoiding any distractions from color variations. 
                                                                        The choice of dark blue provides good contrast against the background.

    Other information about the graph, we want the graders to know: The top two features, age at enrollment and course, stand out with 
                                                                    the highest importance scores (0.11 and 0.10), suggesting that these are the 
                                                                    strongest predictors of student outcomes.


Pathways To Graduation Sankey
    Marks: Marks as nodes are lines that represent the categories involved (e.g., courses, modes, outcomes). Marks as links represent the connection between nodes and are weighted.

    Channels: One of the channels used is position - nodes/lines are positioned horizontally to indicate process stages and vertically to reduce overlap. Another channel is width - the width of the links encodes the flow magnitude. Lastly, color is used to distinguish categories.

    Why we chose this type of visualization: A Sankey diagram is a good tool for showing this data because it visualizes the flows and proportions between categories. For example, it can display student pathways from how they were admitted, through their course choices, to their final outcomes, such as graduating, continuing their studies, or dropping out. The diagram uses different widths to show the magnitude of transitions between categories, helping to identify trends and problems.

    Why did we include the specific color and interactions in the figure: Users can refine the visualization by selecting specific data groups using three sets of checkboxes: Application Modes to choose how students entered the program (e.g., Transfer, International); Courses to select the courses students enrolled in (e.g., Nursing, Tourism); and Outputs to filter by student outcomes (e.g., Graduation, Dropout). These options help users explore details about specific categories. When hovering over nodes or links in the Sankey diagram, tooltips show exact values, like the number of students in a particular transition, which helps users understand specific flows without cluttering the main visualization. Additionally, users can combine selections from different checkbox groups to look at complex interactions, such as examining "International students" who applied for "Nursing" courses and their "Graduation" outcomes.

    Other information about the graph, we want the graders to know: The checkbox interaction for filtering in the Sankey diagram doesn’t work directly on platforms like GitHub because GitHub doesn’t support interactive panel dashboards. However, the code in your repository can be executed locally to enable these features, providing full interactivity for exploration of the data. This ensures that users can still leverage the dynamic functionality of the dashboard when running the code in a suitable environment.
