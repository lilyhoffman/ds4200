    <h1>Student Academic Success & Dropout Rates</h1>

    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Student academic success and dropout rates are critical topics in education research, reflecting
        the overall effectiveness of educational systems and the well-being of students. Academic success,
        often measured by grades, graduation rates, or skill acquisition, profoundly impacts future opportunities,
        career prospects, and socioeconomic mobility. Dropout rates indicate systemic issues, such as resource
        access, student engagement, or support quality. Understanding these factors is essential for
        improving educational practices and fostering equitable learning environments.

    <h3>Data Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedfaizanalii/predict-students-dropout-and-academic-success?resource=download">dataset</a>
        focuses on demographic, academic, and socioeconomic factors at enrollment, aiming to predict student dropout rates
        and academic success. It includes 4,424 rows and 23 columns.
    </p>
    <p>Key features include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Marital status, application mode, and course enrollment:</strong> Insights into personal lives and academic choices.</li>
        <li><strong>Previous qualifications and attendance mode:</strong> Highlights academic history and engagement.</li>
        <li><strong>Parents' academic background:</strong> Includes educational qualifications and occupations as socioeconomic indicators.</li>
    </ul>

    </div>
    <p>
        This visualization highlights the relationship between age at enrollment and unemployment rate, with marital
        status as a factor. Single individuals show more variability in unemployment rates, while married individuals
        display steadier trends. Tooltips enhance interactivity, offering insights into how age, unemployment, and
        marital status interplay.

    <h4>Model Insights</h4>
    <p>The plots provide meaningful insights into the underlying data based on the model's behavior and feature importance. The feature importance plot reveals which variables in the dataset are most strongly associated with the target outcome, indicating which factors are likely driving the observed patterns in the data. The importance rankings can also expose relationships within the data, such as which attributes contribute more to the variability in the target, helping to identify key predictors. Additionally, the distribution of feature importance, whether it's concentrated on a few features or spread out, tells us whether the data relies heavily on certain predictors or is more evenly distributed.</p>
    <p>In this case, the most influential features are <strong>"age at enrollment"</strong> and <strong>"course"</strong> due to the strong connection they have to predicting the participation in school, and therefore are the highest importance in predicting the students' status of graduated, enrolled, or dropout. Besides showing which features are the most influential in the random feature model, the feature importance also shows us that there tends to be a shallow decrease in prediction effect on the rest of the statistical data with "age at enrollment" and "course" at 11% and 10% with the other features averaging at ~7% significance.</p>
    <p>From the confusion matrix, the accuracy across different classes can reflect whether the data has imbalanced classes or overlapping features that make some categories harder to distinguish. If certain classes consistently show high misclassification rates, it might suggest noisy or insufficient data in those areas, indicating a need for further data collection or refinement.</p>
    <p>As we analyze the confusion matrix and the results of the XGBoost model, our focus isn't on improving accuracy; it is learning as much as possible about the data. From the confusion matrix and results, we can see that the prediction results of graduate and dropout individuals are much easier to predict, allowing us to assume more consistent features.
