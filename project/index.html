    <h1> Student Academic Success & Dropout Rates </h1>

    <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>

    <p>Student academic success and dropout rates are critical topics in education research, reflecting
        the overall effectiveness of educational systems and the well-being of students. Academic
        success, often measured by grades, graduation rates, or skill acquisition, has a profound impact
        on a student's future opportunities, career prospects, and socioeconomic mobility. On the other
        hand, dropout rates serve as an indicator of systemic issues, such as access to resources,
        student engagement, or the quality of support services. Understanding the factors influencing
        both academic success and dropout rates is essential not only for improving educational
        practices but also for shaping policies that foster equitable learning environments. Investigating
        these topics can offer insights into how schools, teachers, and policymakers can reduce dropout
        rates, thereby ensuring that more students achieve their full academic potential and contribute
        meaningfully to society</p>

    <h3>Data Introduction</h3>

    <p>  The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedfaizanalii/predict-students-dropout-and-academic-success?resource=download">dataset</a> used in this analysis focuses on various demographic, academic, and socio-economic factors 
        related to students at the time of their enrollment. The Predict Students Dropout and 
        Academic Success dataset aims to predict student dropout rates and academic success. With a shape of 4,424
        rows and 23 columns, this cleaned dataset provides a focused and comprehensive view of the student population under study.

        Key features in the dataset include CHANGE TO ONLY THE COLUMNS PEOPLE USED:
        <!-- Change depending on what everyone wrote: Unknown -->
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Marital status, application mode, and course of enrollment:</strong> These variables provide insights into students' personal lives and academic choices, offering a better understanding of their trajectories.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Previous qualifications and time of attendance (daytime or evening):</strong> These factors highlight students' academic history and engagement levels with their program.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Parents’ academic background:</strong> This includes the highest educational qualifications of the mother and father, as well as their occupations. These socio-economic indicators can significantly influence a student’s academic success.

            <p>In general, west coast states tend to have higher 
                unemployment rate. On the east coast, West virginia 
                and New York state tend to have higher unemplyment rate
                than the others. In the south, Mississippi and Louisiana
                are the ones with the much higher unemplyment rate.

                <p> First, we present an overview of the unemployment rate
                    for all 50 states. Alaska is the one with the 
                    highest unemployment rate, which may due to the seasonal 
                    business in the state. The effectiveness of labor market 
                    policies and governance structures can influence unemployment 
                    rates. Washington, D.C., being the seat of government, may 
                    experience fluctuations in employment related to government 
                    spending and policies. Mississippi and Louisiana have economies 
                    that are heavily reliant on sectors such as agriculture, 
                    manufacturing, and energy. Economic downturns or fluctuations 
                    in these industries can impact employment opportunities. 
                    Connecticut, South Dakota and Virginia have the lowest 
                    unemplyment rate. These states often have diverse economies 
                    with strong sectors such as technology, healthcare, finance, 
                    and tourism. A diverse economy can provide more resilience to 
                    economic downturns.

                <p>Moreover, we also want to examine the relationship between
                    unemployment rate and other social factors in the data. All 
                    features are numerical thus we firts create a correlation
                    plot to examine whether there are linear relationship between 
                    unemployment rate with other social factors. Notice that if 
                    the correlation is small, it only means that there is no potential
                    linear relationship between two features. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on the correlation plot, among all the features, poverty 
                    has the strongest correlation with the unemployment rate since
                    they are both related to the economics. The percentage of single 
                    parents is the second important feature which inidicates the 
                    stability of family is also strongly related to the job market. 
                    The increase of unemployment rate may also related to the increase 
                    of violent crime and murder rate but has a negative relationship
                    with education indicators, like the percentage of people who go to
                    high school and college. The only variable that has no direct linear
                    relation with the unemployment rate is Metropolitan, which means the 
                    percent of residents living in a metropolitan area.

        <p>We have also create an interactive scatter plot so that 
            our users can select a couple of states within
            a certain range of unemployment rate and to see how the 
            other factors may be related here.

            Since we are in MA, thus we want to take a closer look between
            MA and other states. We create the following interactive plot
            such that user can choose another state to compare with MA and 
            show the bar plot on each factors.

        <h3>Summary and additional work</h3>

        <p>
            In this visualization analysis, we try to explore the US 
            unemployment rate across states. We also examine the relation
            between unemployment rate and other social factors. 
        </p>

            Unfortunately, this is the 2010 data thus may be different 
            than the current economics status. Also, unemployment rate 
            may fluctuate seasonally thus adding a time series analysis
            will be more informative.
