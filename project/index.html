    <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Student academic success and dropout rates are critical topics in education research, reflecting
        the overall effectiveness of educational systems and the well-being of students. Academic success,
        often measured by grades, graduation rates, or skill acquisition, profoundly impacts future opportunities,
        career prospects, and socioeconomic mobility. Dropout rates indicate systemic issues, such as resource
        access, student engagement, or support quality. Understanding these factors is essential for
        improving educational practices and fostering equitable learning environments.

    <h3>Data Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedfaizanalii/predict-students-dropout-and-academic-success?resource=download">dataset</a>
        focuses on demographic, academic, and socioeconomic factors at enrollment, aiming to predict student dropout rates
        and academic success. It includes 4,424 rows and 23 columns.
    </p>
    <p>Key features include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Marital status, application mode, and course enrollment:</strong> Insights into personal lives and academic choices.</li>
        <li><strong>Previous qualifications and attendance mode:</strong> Highlights academic history and engagement.</li>
        <li><strong>Parents' academic background:</strong> Includes educational qualifications and occupations as socioeconomic indicators.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This visualization highlights the relationship between age at enrollment and unemployment rate, with marital
        status as a factor. Single individuals show more variability in unemployment rates, while married individuals
        display steadier trends. Tooltips enhance interactivity, offering insights into how age, unemployment, and
        marital status interplay.

            The plots provide meaningful insights into the underlying data based on the model's behavior and feature importance. The feature importance plot highlights which variables in the dataset are most strongly associated with the target outcome, indicating the factors likely driving the observed patterns. These rankings expose relationships within the data, such as which attributes contribute more to the variability in the target, helping identify key predictors. Additionally, the distribution of feature importance—whether concentrated on a few features or spread out—reveals whether the data relies heavily on certain predictors or is more evenly distributed.
        
            In this case, the most influential features are "age at enrollment" and "course" due to their strong connection to predicting school participation. These features have the highest importance in predicting students' statuses as graduated, enrolled, or dropped out. Specifically, "age at enrollment" and "course" contribute 11% and 10% importance, respectively, while the remaining features average around 7% significance. This trend indicates a shallow decrease in prediction effect among other features.
        
            The confusion matrix provides additional insights by showing accuracy across different classes. It reflects whether the data has imbalanced classes or overlapping features that make some categories harder to distinguish. Consistently high misclassification rates for certain classes might suggest noisy or insufficient data, highlighting the need for further data collection or refinement.
        
            In analyzing the confusion matrix and the results of the XGBoost model, our focus shifts from improving accuracy to gaining deeper insights into the data. The results show that predictions for "graduate" and "dropout" individuals are more consistent, suggesting clearer, more stable features for these categories compared to others.
